During week 3 I worked on Lab 1 (LAMP).
I have been succesful in installing, configuring and testing the LAMP stack on my docker container.

My first challange with Lab 1, was the fact that an example showed "cit480" as a start lab, while I named mine "cit160" as I was following CIT 160 instructions provided.
I initially was trying to rename it, however, I've realized that "cit480" image was only used in command examples, and would not be used throughout the lab, therefore, I did not continue to work on resolving this challange.

The main issue that I've encountered, was with a command on page 11 "composer install" which kept failing.
I was able to fix this issue by running "apt-get install php-xml", after which "composer install" executed succesfully.

Currently the lab is due 2 days from now and I have not yet figured out how to create a DockerFile from an image.
While I do understand the part about the installationg of all the packages and dependencies, I am not sure what is the best way to add the nano manual changes to configuration files in DockerFile.
