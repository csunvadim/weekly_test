During week 4 I started working on Lab 2 Ansible Playbooks.

Since the due date was pushed back to the 27th, I decided that instead of finish it now I should first do more research on adible.
I have a few questions about Ansible that I would like to discuss in class, and feel that would be helpful for my overall understanding of this tool.

I also did some research on other technologies such as unrelated to the class activities, such as Spark.
