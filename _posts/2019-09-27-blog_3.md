During week 5 I started working on Lab 2 Ansible Playbooks.

First playbook was installation of a package, creation of 2 groups with 2 users each, and granting full and limited prvieledges for the users of those groups.
Initially, I've had difficulty understanding how to grant permissions for a group to execute only a single package with elevated permissions, and how to programatically add that to the code.
Eventually, after asking a few questions, I was able to improve my understanding of the syntax and incorporate it into the ansible playbook content.

Second playbook, was similar to the assignment from week 3, except that now instead of Dockerfile, we had to configure the LAMP installation user Ansible.
Initially, I was having difficulty determining proper absolute path for instalations, but eventually, I was able to succesfully replicate the LAMP installation process.
For this playbook, I had to add 2 files as these would be extremely messy to edit via terminal.
The files will need to be uploaded into the same directory as the ansible playbook in order for playbook to execute properly.
